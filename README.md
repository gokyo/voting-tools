# Catalyst Voting Tools

A library and series of executables to aid programmers and users to
interact with the voting capabilities of Catalyst.

The "voter-registration" executable aids the user in registering to
vote. The executable creates a transaction, with the vote registration
encoded as transaction metadata, signs the transaction, and then
returns this signed transaction to the user, so they can submit it to
the chain.

The "voting-tools" executable has two functions: "genesis" and
"rewards". The "genesis" tool creates a genesis JSON file from a
"genesis-template.json" file, populating the file with the initial
funds and block-zero date. The "rewards" tool calculates the voting
rewards that should be given to each user and optionally generates the
appropriate MIR certificates.
